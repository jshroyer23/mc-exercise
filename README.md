Merge conflicts occur when files get out of sync between GitHub and a user’s local code base, and Git becomes unsure of where HEAD really is.

Let’s describe and experience how a pretend team would get into that situation and then extricate themselves from it.

Results from exercise:
1. It is always important to make sure that you are working in your own local branch instead of master to avoid conflicts
2. Always do a git pull when starting to make sure that you are working on up-to-date content.
3. Whenever someone does a push everyone should stop and do a pull to help avoid merge conflicts.
